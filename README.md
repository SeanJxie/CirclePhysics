# CirclePhysics
- A small "header-source" physics engine I'm working on to imporve my physics and programming knowledge over time.
- An interactive 64-bit `exe`  demo can be found in `Interactive.zip`. The code for the interactive can be found in `main.cpp`.
- For graphics and input device handling, I use SDL.
